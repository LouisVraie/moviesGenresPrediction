---

## Context

The main goal of this project was to predict the genre of movies based on the synopsis. 

## Data

For the data we used [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv), on Kaggle from Full MovieLens Dataset, 2018 uploaded by Rounak Banik.
It contains 45,000+ movies released between 1874 and 2017 with a lot of features.

- Original data : `movies_metadata.csv`

## Work

We performed a pre-processing on the dataset and train and test the data on different models.
